# estimAADTion-software
 
EstimAADTion is a software designed for SCDOT to estimate Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) using short-term count data. SCDOT conducts short-term counts at different locations in the state periodically. This software has been designed to estimate the AADT at those locations from the short-term counts at those locations. The software uses Support Vector Regression (SVR) to estimate the AADT. In order to estimate AADT from short-term counts, the software uses data from permanent count stations (ATRs). The software provides the capability to collect the permanent count station data from the SCDOT website to facilitate the use of the permanent count stations.
